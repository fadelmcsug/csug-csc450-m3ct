# C++ Pointers Dynamic Allocation
This program takes 3 integer inputs from the user, assigns them to variables, and creates pointers to those variables using dynamic memory allocation. It then displays the values of the variables and the addresses and values in the pointers. Finally, it deletes the pointers to free up memory and avoid memory leaks.
